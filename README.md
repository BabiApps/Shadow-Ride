Shadow Ride

# Shadow Ride
This feature will help you decide where to sit on your next bus ride.

# What's the problem?
Do you know that when you take the bus and there's sunlight on your face the entire way?
You can't look out the window, because you're burning hot.
So, you're trying to figure out where you should sit for the most shade.

# What does it do?
This feature calculates where the most shadow on your bus's rides and tells you where you should sit.
