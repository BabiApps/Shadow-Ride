# 🌘 Shadow Ride

**Find the shadiest seat on your next bus ride.**  
Tired of getting baked by the sun through the window? Shadow Ride helps you choose where to sit for maximum shade.

---

## 🚨 The Problem

Ever been stuck on the sunny side of the bus with the sun blazing in your face?  
No view, just heat. 🥵  
You're left guessing where the shade might be.

---

## ✅ The Solution

Shadow Ride calculates the sun’s position during your ride and shows you where the **shady side** of the bus will be — so you can sit more comfortably.

## 🌐 Live Demo

Supports WebAPK for installable experience on Android!

## 🧠 How It Works

- Determines your **route and direction**
- Calculates **sun position** using live data
- Suggests **best seat** for shade, based on sunlight angle and bus orientation
- Uses interactive **maps and icons** to visualize it all in real-time
